Can we insert data into an array at a negative index? If so, why is this possible?

Yes, data can be inserted using a negative index.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[-1] = 0;

arr; // => [1, 2, 3, '-1': 0]
```

When returning the array with the new negative index, its value, along with the index, will appear at the end of the array. This value does *not* affect the length of the array, so its length will remain as `3`.
