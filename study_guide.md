- Data Types
    - Primitives
    - Objects
        - Simple Objects
        - Arrays
        - Dates
        - Functions
- Nullish Coalescing Operator
    - https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/flow_control
    - `??`
    - Nullish means `null` or `undefined`
- Switch

    - Similar, but different than `case` statements
    - Fall-throughs
- Increment/Decrement Operator
    - ++/--
    - Before variable increments, but returns old value
    - After variable increments and returns new value
    - Should be avoided, use +=/-= instead
- do loop
    - Always performs loop once
- continue
    - Same as `next` in Ruby
- forEach
    - same as `#each`
- Arrow functions
- Template Literal
    - Using `` to interpolate values into a string
- `push` returns the new array length
- `filter`
    - Similar to `#select`
- Element reference with the bracket notation
    - `arr[1][3]`
- Objects
    - Same as Ruby hashes
    - To reference a string, can either use
        - dot notation
            - `person.name`
        - bracket notation
            - person['name']
        - Can also use these notations for assignment
    - `delete` keyword to delete a key/value
- Iterate over an Object
    - `for (let property in variable) {}`
    - Iterates over the prototypes as well
- `keys` and `values` methods are static
- `for/of`
    - Better to use this with an array
    - https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff
- `?.` returns the entire chain as `undefined` if the value is nullish
    - "Optional Chaining"
    - https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/more_stuff
- regex
    - `test` returns `true` or `false`
    - `match` returns matched values or `null`
    - Weird problem in book...look into this
